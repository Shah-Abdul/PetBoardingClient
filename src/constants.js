We are pet lovers and so our mission is to make sure that our guests feel as comfortable and happy\
 as possible while you are away. Not only we provide an immaculate, calm environment, but also we\
  take the necessary precautions to protect your pet(s) from any harm. \n\n
Before we agree to service you, we will schedule a small Meet & Greet between you (the pet owner)\
 and your pet at our location. We are interviewing each other. We must make sure we are a good \
 fit for each other to protect the well being of all parties.\n\n
We won’t be able to service you unless if the meet and greet is not done prior to the boarding.\
 No exceptions. \n\n
During the meet and greet, we need to verify your pet(s) are current with all shots (rabies, \
  bordetella, and DHPP), determine their temperament and discuss their regular routine and care.\
  \n\n
All pets must be under a flea and tick control and heartworm preventative treatment. No \
exceptions.\n\n
We prefer you schedule your service at least 72 hours in advance so we will have enough time to \
perform the meet and greet and offer your pet a complimentary overnight stay or doggie daycare \
day to see how your pet does in a new environment.`;
